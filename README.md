# Text-to-Image Generator with GPT-4

This project is a **Text-to-Image Generator** web application that allows users to type a descriptive prompt and receive an AI-generated image in return. The application integrates **OpenAI's GPT-4** model, which processes user input and generates images based on the entered prompt.

### Features:
- **User Input**: A simple text input field for users to describe the image they want to generate.
- **AI-Generated Images**: Leveraging GPT-4, combined with OpenAI's DALLÂ·E API (or similar models), the app generates high-quality images based on the prompt.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface with responsive elements for smooth interaction across devices.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API for text-to-image generation.
  
### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-image-generator.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
